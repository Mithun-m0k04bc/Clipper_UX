# 🚀 Push to GitHub - Quick Guide

## ✅ Git is Ready!

I've initialized Git and committed all your code.

## 📋 **3 Steps to Push to GitHub:**

### **Step 1: Create GitHub Repository**

I just opened this for you: https://github.com/new

On that page:
1. **Repository name:** `clipper` (or any name you want)
2. **Description:** "Clipper Product Details Page with Living Design"
3. **Keep it Private** (unless you want it public)
4. **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README" (we already have code)
5. Click **"Create repository"**

---

### **Step 2: Copy the Commands GitHub Shows**

After creating the repo, GitHub will show commands like:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/clipper.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

### **Step 3: Run Those Commands**

Open Terminal and paste those 3 commands (they'll push your code to GitHub)

---

## 🎯 **Then Deploy to Vercel:**

1. Go back to: https://vercel.com/new
2. Click "Import Git Repository"
3. Select your `clipper` repository
4. Click "Deploy"
5. Done! 🎉

## 🔄 **OR - I Can Push For You:**

If you create the GitHub repository and tell me:
- Your GitHub username
- The repository name you created

I can run the push commands for you!

---

## 📝 **What's Already Done:**

✅ Git initialized
✅ .gitignore created (excludes node_modules, dist, etc.)
✅ All files committed
✅ Ready to push!

Just create the GitHub repo and we're good to go! 🚀
